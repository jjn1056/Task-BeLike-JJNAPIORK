# NAME

Task::BeLike::JJNAPIORK - Stuff I use to start or maintain a CPAN project

# SYNOPSIS

    cpanm Task::BeLike::JJNAPIORK

# DESCRIPTION

When I bootstrap a new project, or when someone wants to contribute to one of
my projects, there's a handful of modules you need which are not listed in the
`Makefile.PL`.  Think of these as 'meta' projects files, or like a SDK for 
working on CPAN modules.  They are not things someone who is just using the
module needs, just authors.

This module is intended to bundle those together so as to make
it faster for me to bootstrap a new project and to make it easier for anyone
that wants to contribute to a project I am working on.  Also, its one less
thing I need to do when getting started on a new project or reviving an old
one.

# USAGE

Typically when I start a new project, I build my `Makefile.PL` around the
[Module::Install](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install) ecosystem.  I also use [App::cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::cpanminus) and a few other bits
to make using [local::lib](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local::lib) and git easier.  This means before I can even get
started (or a contributor started) we need some unnecessary ceremony.  The
`Makefile.PL` is great for managing the dependencies of a project, but it
can't recursively manage its own dependencies, which means that authors (NOT
installers) will always need to install a few bits to get started working.  My
goal here is to reduce that effort, at least for my current workflow.  Hopefully
you will catch some useful ideas that work for you.

Unlike most of the distributions in the Task::BeLike namespace (see: 
<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Task::BeLike>), this is not a
catchall of everything I love to use.  This is a pretty minimum list, most of
which have no or few dependencies with a very high rate of installation
success.  So if you want to be like me when starting a new project, this is it!

Typically I assume a locally installed perl (which is probably installed via
[App::perlbrew](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::perlbrew)) and nothing else when starting a project.  I then bootstrap a
[local::lib](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local::lib) managed local directory of the basic dependencies and go from
there.  I use the online version of [App::cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::cpanminus) to get this rolling:

  curl http://cpanmin.us/ -L | perl - -l ~/mylocal Task::BeLike::JJNAPIORK

After that, I open a command interpreter who's environment has been fixed up to
find the [local::lib](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local::lib) which [App::cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::cpanminus) has created:

  ~/mylocal/bin/localenv bash

After that I will use the project `Makefile.PL` to install project level
dependencies, start a new project, etc.

# MODULES INSTALLED

This [Task](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Task) module installs the following

- [App::cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::cpanminus)

Easier to install CPAN modules

- [App::local::lib::helper](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::local::lib::helper)

Make it easier to use [local::lib](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local::lib)

- [Module::Setup](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Setup)

For when I am too lazy to make my own project skeletons

- [Module::Setup::Flavor::JJNAPIORK](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Setup::Flavor::JJNAPIORK)

If I am using [Module::Setup](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Setup) I want a flavor that makes sense to me.

- [Module::Install](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install)

Easier to manage your project dependencies.

- [Module::Install::Repository](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install::Repository)

Add source control repository information to META

- [Module::Install::AutoManifest](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install::AutoManifest)

Make and clean manifest files for me.

- [Module::Install::ReadmeMarkdownFromPod](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install::ReadmeMarkdownFromPod)

Make the readme file I am always forgetting to do. Markdown has become
popular since its very readable in a text view and if you are using Github
it will get parsed and rendered very nicely.

- [Module::Install::ManifestSkip](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install::ManifestSkip)

Start you off with a sane MANIFEST.SKIP file.

- [Module::Install::Homepage](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install::Homepage)

Set or guess a reasonable homepage for your module.

- [Module::Install::AutoLicense](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install::AutoLicense)

Create a lICENSE file it it is missing.
