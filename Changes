    - took out CARP::REPL since it's a debugging tool, not something that fits
      the role of this module which is intended to be a sort of personal SDK,
      not a catchall of everything I use all the time.
    - Add Module::Install::ManifestSkip since I hate having to copy this around
      and have it clutter up my repo.
    - Added MI:ReadmeFromPOD since sometimes we want a text only README.
